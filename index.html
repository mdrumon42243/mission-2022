                    deliver market-defining high-quality solutions that create value and consistent competitive

                </div>
                <h1>Goals</h1>
                <p>I want to become a freelance/remote website/app developer. I hated the routine life and other things
                    related to a 9/5 job.
                    Currently, I'm working on revising my web development skills. I have worked with HTML and CSS for
                    about 4 and a half months. Now I want to work on web development more as there are better growth
                    opportunities.
                    Planning on doing a certification in MERN stack so I can get into full-stack development which I
                    believe is going to be a great career choice for the future.</p>
